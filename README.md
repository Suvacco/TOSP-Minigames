# Old School Project

The "OS Project" is an open source Minecraft minigame plugin that brings classic minigames from 2012 to nowadays. The project was developed with Java under the Bukkit API.

## Getting Started

Since this plugin isn't released in Spigot or Bukkit forums yet, you'll need to compile it yourself. I suggest taking a read in this topic before trying anything:

[Spigot Plugin Development](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-plugin-development/)

I'll increment this README with a step by step tutorial when the first release rolls out.

## Have fun!
