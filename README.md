# OS Minigames

This plugin recreates the old style of lobbys and implements some classic 2012-ish minigames

## Getting Started

Since this plugin isn't released in Spigot or Bukkit forums yet, you'll need to compile it yourself. I suggest taking a read in this topic before trying anything:

[Spigot Plugin Development](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-plugin-development/)

I'll increment this README with a step by step tutorial when the first release rolls out.

## What is "TOSP" ?

The Old School Project (TOSP) is an open source Minecraft project that aims to bring classic server styles from 2012 to nowadays. The project was developed with Java under the Bukkit API. 

> None the less, I think it's safe to say that this is a personal project, please do not expect a professional approach. I'm trying to recreate nostalgia based solely in my passion for coding and old memories from a long time ago. 

## Thanks for sticking on!
